Blind Compass is a compass app specifically designed for blind people. First, it reports your heading continuously by varying pitch, so that even with not much musical training you can easily memorize how the right direction sounds like, and you'll be able to walk in straight line just by listening to your direction. Also when your heading crosses North,East, South, or West you will hear that spoken to you.
I recommend to use Blind Compass with bone conductance bluetooth headphones. Bone conductance headphones don't block ears, so that you can hear sounds from the environment, as well as audio feedback from BlindCompasss.
You can also have your heading spoken by either pressing button in the app, or if you are using bluetooth headphones, you can press play button once.
Second, Blind Compass allows you to lock your direction. Either press lock button in the app, or press fast forward button on your headphones, or double press play button on your headphones, and your direction will be locked. You will hear auditory feedback guiding you back to the original heading. If you allow Blind Compass to use location data, then it will also count distance travelled from the point where you locked your location. This way you can cross vast open space without fear of veering.
